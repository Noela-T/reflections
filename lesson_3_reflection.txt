Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Answer:
      I would want to use a remote repository to keep all work always. This repository will serve 
      as backup for all the work on my local computer should in case anything happens to the work 
      on my computer, I would be able to retreive all of it from github.
