Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
  your work local?
  Answer:
      I would want to use a remote repository to keep all work always. This
      repository will serve as backup for all the work on my local computer
      should in case anything happens to the work on my computer, I would be
      able to retreive all of it from github.

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
  Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Answer:
      You might want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
      automatically stay up-to-date so that you actually know what you want you
      are copying to your local machine  to avoid errors and redundancies.

Question: Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When
  would you use one instead of another?
  Answer:
      Fork is used to copy someone's repository on github to your own github
      repository.
      Clones are used to copy a repository from github to your local computer.
      They are also used to copy repositories/files from one spot to another on
      your local computer.
      Branches are labels given to commits made on files. They are used in
      tracking commits and their parents.
      Forks are used when you don't have permission to edit files on a repository.
      When you fork the repository to your own account, you can easily edit it.
      Clones are used to copy this repository to your local computer so that
      you can easily work on the files.
      Branches are used to make changes to files without necessarily affecting
      the original. Useful for adding new features and experimenting with your work.
