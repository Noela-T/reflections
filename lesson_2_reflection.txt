Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Answer:
      When you initialize a repository, you make it a git folder.
      You do it to enable Git to track changes made to that repository.

Question: How is staging area different from working directory and the repository?
  What value do you think it offers?
  Answer:
      Staging area is an intermediary between working directory and the repository.
      It is another part of git.
      It adds more flexibility to git. If you make some changes and you are not
      sure if you want to commit yet, but you want to save it, you can add the
      files to staging area. They won't be committed, but the changes won't get
      lost either.
